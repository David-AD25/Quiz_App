It is a leading provider of software and services in hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence, and enterprise and strategic consulting services.

### Project Overview

This project develops an **IBM Code of Conduct & Ethics Quiz**, designed for internal use at IBM. The aim of the application is to provide IBMers with an accessible and interactive way to reinforce their understanding of IBM’s ethical standards, including topics such as conflicts of interest, data confidentiality, responsible use of technology, and reporting unethical behaviour.

The application allows users to answer multiple‑choice questions, receive immediate feedback on their performance, and have results securely stored for review or export. In terms of relevance, by testing knowledge through a structured quiz, the application supports ongoing compliance awareness and helps promote a consistent ethical culture across the organisation.

### Technical and Non‑Technical Perspective

From a non‑technical standpoint, the application effectively highlights how software solutions can be used to support ethical considerations, governance, and professional standards within a large enterprise.

From a technical standpoint, the application follows a professional development lifecycle. It is designed, built iteratively, tested, deployed, and documented. The project is developed in **Python** and uses a graphical user interface created via the **Tkinter** library. Additionally, the application incorporates object‑oriented principles, alongside automated testing and continuous integration.
